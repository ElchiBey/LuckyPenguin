# LuckyPenguin

### The rules of the game
The game board consists of 11 fields, from F2 to F12, on which you can place or remove fish in the course of the game. 
At the beginning of the game all fields are empty. The game can be played by 2 to any number of penguins.
When it is a penguin turn, he rolls two dice.
  For all fields except 2, 7 and 12: If a fish is already on the field, the penguin wins the fish. But if the field was empty, the penguin must put a fish on the field.
  In space 7 there is a wedding: The penguin must put a fish on the field, regardless of how many fish there are already.
  In field 2 the penguin is a lucky penguin: The lucky penguin wins all fish from all fields except from field 7!
  In space 12 the penguin is a king penguin: The king penguin wins all fish that are on the board!
  
The current penguin can then decide to stop immediately and keep all of his fish. If he's out of fish anyway, he must stop playing.
At the end of the game, the penguins that have the most fish win. Mind that, there can be several winning penguins, too.
